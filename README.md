# Simple Chat App

## Description

Simple Chatbot is an application which implements socket programming to connect multiple clients to a server in a Local Area Network (LAN) using a local IP Address. The server can be started and the clients can connect to the server directly after installation. In the server, clients can communicate through each other by sending a message.

## Installation Guide

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the server script to start a local server.
3. Run the client script in another terminal to connect a client to the server. To connect multiple clients, run client instances in separate terminals.
4. Send messages from the client terminal
5. Messages should appear back at the server terminal
